Welcome to DDT's documentation!
===============================

DDT (Data-Driven Tests) allows you to multiply one test case
by running it with different test data, and make it appear as
multiple test cases.

You can find (and fork) the project in https://github.com/txels/ddt.

DDT should work on Python2 and Python3, but we only officially test it for
versions 2.7 and 3.3.
