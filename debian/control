Package: python-ddt
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         ${python:Depends},
Description: Data-Driven/Decorated Tests - Python 2.x
 DDT (Data-Driven Tests) allows you to multiply one test case by running it
 with different test data, and make it appear as multiple test cases. DDT
 consists of a class decorator ddt (for your TestCase subclass) and two
 method decorators (for your tests that want to be multiplied).
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
